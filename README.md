Pitch


I want to write an article that shows the data on the numbers of new cases of HIV in New York and the numbers of PREP (a 1 pill daily dose that prevents HIV contagion) users filtered by race/ethnicity. From what Iâ€™ve seen analyzing the numbers of new cases, the black and hispanic community have the highest numbers of new cases per year and also the fewest users of PREP.  I would like to research on what is New York city doing to promote the usage of PREP among the black and hispanic community, maybe finding out reasons why this population is not benefiting from this pill. Is it because of a lack of information? Are there enough programs directed to these communities to let them know the existence of this pill and its benefits? 
I found web with the latest numbers on PREP in New York city, https://etedashboardny.org/data/prevention/prep-nys/
