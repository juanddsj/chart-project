Pitch


I want to write an article that shows the data on the numbers of new cases of HIV in New York and the numbers of PREP (a 1 pill daily dose that prevents HIV contagion) users filtered by race/ethnicity. From what Iâ€™ve seen analyzing the numbers of new cases, the black and hispanic community have the highest numbers of new cases per year and also the fewest users of PREP.  I would like to research on what is New York city doing to promote the usage of PREP among the black and hispanic community. 

I found web with the latest numbers on PREP in New York city, https://etedashboardny.org/data/prevention/prep-nys/
Also found this numbers on NYC DATA https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/index.html
